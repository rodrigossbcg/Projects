<font size=4> In this exercise I am going to use <b>linear regression techniques</b> to predict the target variable (<b>SalePrice</b>). For this effect I will be using two datasets from kaggle. One is the train dataset, wich we will use to prform all the data preparation and modeling. The other one is the test dataset, that we will use at the end of the exercise to make our predictions.
