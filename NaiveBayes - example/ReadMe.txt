In this notebook I am going to implement a very simple example of the Naive Bayes algorithm. The dataset in use will be the famous Iris, used many times for classification 
demonstrations. This dataset has information about 3 Species of Iris (Setosa, Versicolour, Virginica). The main goal is for our model to read the data and identify
each observation correctly, as Setosa, Versicolour or Virginica.
