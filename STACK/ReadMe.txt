In this work we will be talking about de STACK data structure. To understand how this data structure works read the P2_QUEUE.docx,
there we explain the logic behind it and different implementations. After you understood the concept you can also see the P2_QUEUE.py
file, there you have access to the python code that creates this data structure. We hope you enjoy it!
